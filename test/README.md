Minimal Fully Working Example
=============================

This folder contains a minimal fully working Jekyll project that illustrates how to use the KaTeX blocks to generate the equations as HTML and CSS, server-side.

The KaTeX CSS file `katex.min.css`, javascript file `katex.min.js` and font files under `fonts/*` are all Copyright (c) 2014 Khan Academy.
You can download them directly from the [KaTeX GitHub repository](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX).
